# Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}

{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicelong}} helps you provision encrypted keys for apps across {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}}. As you manage the lifecycle of your keys, you can benefit from knowing that your keys are secured by cloud-based hardware security modules (HSMs) that protect against the theft of information.

{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} is automatically available to all apps within the space in which it is created. [After you create an instance of the service ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/key-protect/?taxonomyNavigation=apps){: new_window}, complete the following steps to get up and running:

1. To create or upload an existing key, click **Add Key**.
    Specify the key's details:
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Setting</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Name</td>
        <td>A human-readable alias to assign to your key. The name can be anything to help you identify the key, such as what the key is used for or who the key is associated with.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Algorithm</td>
        <td>Symmetric key encryption is supported by the AES-GCM algorithm.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Key</td>
        <td>Only required if you are adding an existing key. The key material can be any type of data you want to store in the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} service, such as a certificate or RSA key.</td>
      </tr>
        <caption style="caption-side:bottom;">Table 1. Description of the key settings</caption>
    </table>

2. When you are finished filling out the key's details, click **Add Key** to confirm. Keys are available immediately. New keys are generated by hardware security modules that are located in secure {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} data centers.
3. Copy the reference identifier in the row of the key. The **ID** value is the identifier that you use in the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} API.
4. **Optional**: If you want to delete a key, keep in mind that the key material is not recoverable. Metadata that is associated with the key is kept in the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} database. To delete a key, click the **Actions** icon in the row of the key and confirm the deletion in the next screen.

Now, you can use your keys to code your apps and services.
